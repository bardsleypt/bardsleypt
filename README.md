Hi, I am Patrick Bardsley, applied mathematician, statistician, and
machine learning dev by day, climbing bum by night.


# About Me
- I am interested in ...
  - being outside more than being inside
  - climbing and skiing
  - mathematics and physics in their full, broad, and general glory
  - quantum mechanics
  - wave phenomena
  - abstract gradient flow formulations
  - Star Wars (in order: 5, 4, 6 #EmpireDidNothingWrong)
- I am currently learning ...
  - electrochemistry and mathematical modelling of lithium ion batteries
  - how to structure my days to nurture and build creativity
  - `while True:`<br>    `[self.learn(val) for val in ['python', 'cool_python_packages']]`
- I am looking to collborate on ...
  - anything with a mathematical physics aspect to it
  - anything with a statistical spin to it
  - machine learning projects (mostly signal processing)
  - anything pythonic
