Hi, I am Patrick Bardsley, applied mathematician, statistician, and
machine learning dev by day, climbing bum by night.


# About Me
- I am interested in ...
  - being outside more than being inside
  - climbing and skiing
  - mathematics and physics in their full, broad, and general glory
  - quantum mechanics
  - wave phenomena
  - abstract gradient flow formulations
  - Star Wars (in order: 5, 4, 6 #EmpireDidNothingWrong)
- I am currently learning ...
  - electrochemistry and mathematical modelling of lithium ion batteries
  - `while True:`<br>    `[self.learn(val) for val in ['python', 'cool_python_packages']]`
- I am looking to collaborate on ...
  - anything with a mathematical physics aspect to it
  - anything with a statistical spin to it
  - machine learning projects (mostly signal processing)
  - anything pythonic

# My Portfolio

## Codebase
Within this repository, I have included a fully functional codebase
which can be used to train and test a neural-network-based
shape-classifier. Essentially, the classifier infers the order of a
polynomial with one of two architectures:
  - MLP architecture
  - Custom-kernel convolutional architecture

While this codebase and its classifier is fully functional, no efforts
have been made for tuning (hyper)parameters. Rather the code is in place
purely for demonstrative purposes and to collect some routines I
regularly use. 

A top-level jupyter-notebook is available to demonstrate the calling behavior
of this codebase. By default, the notebook will execute:
  - synthetic data generation
  - a small 20-epoch training iteration
  - model calibration
  - model testing/validation
